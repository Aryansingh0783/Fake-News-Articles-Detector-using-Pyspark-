# Fake News Classification with PySpark üöÄ

This project leverages PySpark to create a scalable machine learning pipeline that identifies whether news articles are **real** or **fake**. By analyzing both textual content and metadata, the goal is to combat misinformation and enhance trustworthiness in news dissemination.

## üìÑ **Overview**
- **Purpose**: To develop a reliable machine learning solution for classifying news articles as fake or real.
- **Dataset**: A publicly available dataset from Kaggle containing fields such as article title, text, author, publication date, and source.
- **Focus Areas**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, model building, and performance evaluation.

## üîç **Key Features**
1. **Text Analysis**:
   - Processed article titles and body text using TF-IDF vectorization.
   - Generated additional text-based features like word and character counts.
2. **Incorporation of Metadata**:
   - Utilized information like author name, publication date, and source (when available).
3. **Visual Insights**:
   - Created visual representations of text features and class distributions.
4. **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
   - Implemented Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest for classification tasks.

## üîß **Steps Involved**
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Identified and addressed missing values in critical fields like text and author.
   - Applied text cleaning techniques, including the removal of stop words and punctuation.
   - Transformed text data into numerical format using vectorization methods.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted statistical features such as sentiment scores and text length.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Examined patterns in text and metadata through visualizations like word clouds and histograms.
4. **Model Training and Validation**:
   - Split the dataset for training and testing.
   - Trained multiple models and optimized their performance through hyperparameter tuning.
5. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
6. **Visualization**:
   - Displayed results using confusion matrices, feature importance charts, and ROC curves.

## ‚ö° **Anticipated Results**
- A robust and accurate classification model capable of distinguishing fake news from real news.
- Insights into the linguistic and structural features that are indicative of fake news.
- A valuable tool for reducing misinformation in digital media.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies**
- **Big Data Framework**: PySpark MLlib for scalable model training.
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries and Tools**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Visualization Techniques**: Word clouds, ROC curves, and confusion matrices.

## üåü **Applications**
- **Media Industry**: Automating the identification of potentially false articles.
- **Social Awareness**: Highlighting common patterns in fake news to educate the public.
- **Content Platforms**: Enhancing content credibility by identifying unreliable sources.
